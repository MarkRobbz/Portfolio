                <P>*PLACEHOLDER* Being a part of a generation that relies heavily on technology to complete tasks and awareness of the vital
                    information this technology’s role holds for business, had got me interested in computers. The world almost
                    revolves around the use of this innovation because it has become central to commerce and government. When I
                    studied I.T. for two years at Belfast Metropolitan College, I realised it was something I was good at and could
                    be fulfilled with in the world of work. Since college, I have been eager to learn more and began a degree in
                    Computer Science at Queen’s University Belfast.
                    Studying the Architecture and Networks module at Queen’s Belfast has enabled me to learn many new topics such as
                    an in-depth look at how we send and receive data across a network using different protocols. My favourite module
                    of this semester would be web technologies. I really enjoy the creative aspect of this module as we get to build
                    responsive websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this module, I have worked steadily while being under
                    pressure to meet deadlines.
                    I have advanced my organisational skills as I am required to organise the workload from different modules in
                    order to complete them on time. Coding with Java in Procedural and Object Orientated programming has allowed me
                    to improve on my problem-solving skills. This requires me to think through steps strategically to overcome a
                    difficult task. It is rewarding to complete a challenging program. For instance, one of my assignments required
                    a program to be created that involved implementing code. It needed to act as a compiler so it would read code
                    from a file and return the different data types used, reporting any errors with the code.
                    I completed a week of work experience at an I.T. company called Xperience and was introduced to cloud solutions,
                    custom relations management (CRM) and accounting where I got to observe the different departments. During this I
                    picked up team building skills. I got to use problem-solving skills to work independently, such as setting up
                    new computers for different organisations and connecting them to their servers. I learned the importance of good
                    communication skills when dealing with customers during my work experience.
