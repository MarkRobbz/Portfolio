                        <h4>Hello there.</h4>
                        <P>
                            *PLACEHOLDER* Being a part of a generation that relies heavily on technology to complete
                            tasks and awareness of the vital
                            information this technology’s role holds for business, had got me interested in computers.
                            The world almost
                            revolves around the use of this innovation because it has become central to commerce and
                            government. When I
                            studied I.T. for two years at Belfast Metropolitan College, I realised it was something I
                            was good at and could
                            be fulfilled with in the world of work. Since college, I have been eager to learn more and
                            began a degree in
                            Computer Science at Queen’s University Belfast.
                            Studying the Architecture and Networks module at Queen’s Belfast has enabled me to learn
                            many new topics such as
                            an in-depth look at how we send and receive data across a network using different protocols.
                            My favourite module
                            of this semester would be web technologies. I really enjoy the creative aspect of this
                            module as we get to build
                            responsive websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this module, I have worked steadily
                            while being under
                            pressure to meet deadlines.
